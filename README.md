### What I learned

### **What I Learned About Form Validation**

I learned that client-side validation is essential for ensuring user inputs meet specific criteria before submission. It provides immediate feedback, improving user experience by preventing incomplete or incorrect data. By using tools like HTML attributes and JavaScript, I implemented rules such as restricting input types, checking for required fields, and validating patterns like emails or numbers. This approach makes the application more user-friendly while reducing unnecessary server requests.

### Continued development

Server-side validation ensures that form inputs are securely and reliably validated on the server after submission. This process is crucial for maintaining data integrity and protecting against security threats like tampering, SQL injection, and XSS attacks. I plan to learn how to implement server-side validation by defining validation rules, sanitizing inputs, and providing error feedback to users. This will complement client-side validation and enhance the overall security and robustness of my application.
